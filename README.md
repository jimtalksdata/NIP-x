# Nyzo improvement protocol 1 - NIP-1

This is a frontrunner to the nyzo tech repository which at time of writing does not contain any information. All information currently available is in the whitepaper, or scattered in discord conversations.

The current protocol will be described in NP-x.md, as easy to understand and broad as possible.
NIP focuses on the intricacies and economic side of things.

You can start a discussion or suggestion by opening an issue, if this repository ever becomes unmaintained you can fork it, or pre-emptively fork it to assure immutable discussion around the Nyzo protocol. I will maintain this repository for as long and in the extent necessary.

**If your issue is a suggestion, please label your issue**

Where NP x = the current protocol 'version'

NP1: NIP1
NP1: NIP2
NP2: NIP1
NP2: NIP2

Referencing in issues is possible in the same way and makes it easy to do so.
